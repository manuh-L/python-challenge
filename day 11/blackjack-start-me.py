############### Our Blackjack House Rules #####################

## The deck is unlimited in size. 
## There are no jokers. 
## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
## Use the following list as the deck of cards:
## cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
## The computer is the dealer.

##################### Hints #####################

#Hint 1: Go to this website and try out the Blackjack game: 
#   https://games.washingtonpost.com/games/blackjack/
#Then try out the completed Blackjack project here: 
#   http://blackjack-final.appbrewery.repl.run

#Hint 2: Read this breakdown of program requirements: 
#   http://listmoz.com/view/6h34DJpvJBFVRlZfJvxF
#Then try to create your own flowchart for the program.

#Hint 3: Download and read this flow chart I've created: 
#   https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1rDkiHCrhaf9eX7u7yjM1qwSuyEk-rPnt

#Hint 4: Create a deal_card() function that uses the List below to *return* a random card.
#11 is the Ace.
#cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]

def deal_card():
    cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
    return random.choice(cards)

def compare(user_score,comp_score):
    if user_score == comp_score:
        return "Draw"
    elif comp_score == 0:
        return "Lose, opponent has blackjack"
    elif user_score == 0:
        return "Win, with a blackjack"
    elif user_score > 21:
        return "You went over. you lose"
    elif comp_score > 21:
        return "opponent went over, you Win" 
    elif user_score > comp_score:
        return "You win"
    else:
        return "You lose"


#print(deal_card())
#Hint 5: Deal the user and computer 2 cards each using deal_card() and append().



    


#print(user_cards,'\n',computer_cards)

#Hint 6: Create a function called calculate_score() that takes a List of cards as input 
#and returns the score. 
#Look up the sum() function to help you do this.

#def calculate_score(cards_list):
#    score = 0
#    for card in cards_list:
#        score += card
#    return  score
def calculate_score(cards_list):

    #Hint 7: Inside calculate_score() check for a blackjack (a hand with only 2 cards: ace + 10) and return 0 instead of the actual score. 0 will represent a blackjack in our game.
    #    if 11 in cards_list and 10 in cards_list and len(cards_list) == 2: 
      if sum(cards_list) == 21 and len(cards_list) == 2:          
          return 0
      if 11 in cards_list and sum(cards_list) > 21:
          cards_list[cards_list.index(11)] = 1
    #        cards_list.remove(11)
    #        cards_list.append(1)
            
      return  sum(cards_list)


def play():
    print(logo)

    user_cards = []
    computer_cards = []
    user_cards = [deal_card(),deal_card()]
    computer_cards = [deal_card(),deal_card()]
#    for _ in range(2):
#    user_cards.append(deal_card())
#    computer_cards.append(deal_card())
    game_over = False

    while not game_over:

        user = calculate_score(user_cards)
        comp = calculate_score(computer_cards)


        print(f"Your cards: {user_cards}, current score: {user}")
        print(f"Computers cards: {computer_cards[0]}")

        if user == 0 or comp == 0 or user > 21:
            game_over = True
        else:
            another_pass = input("Type 'y' to get another card, type 'n' to pass: ")
            if another_pass == "y":
                user_cards.append(deal_card())
            else:
                game_over = True
    
    while comp != 0 and comp < 17:
        computer_cards.append(deal_card())
        comp = calculate_score(computer_cards)

    print(f"CPU cards: {computer_cards} \n CPU final score: {comp}")
    final_result = compare(user,comp)
    print(final_result)

while input("Play +1 game? type 'y' or 'n': ") == "y":
    clear()
    play()

#Hint 8: Inside calculate_score() check for an 11 (ace). If the score is already over 21, remove the 11 and replace it with a 1. You might need to look up append() and remove().

#Hint 9: Call calculate_score(). If the computer or the user has a blackjack (0) or if the user's score is over 21, then the game ends.

#Hint 10: If the game has not ended, ask the user if they want to draw another card. If yes, then use the deal_card() function to add another card to the user_cards List. If no, then the game has ended.

#Hint 11: The score will need to be rechecked with every new card drawn and the checks in Hint 9 need to be repeated until the game ends.

#Hint 12: Once the user is done, it's time to let the computer play. The computer should keep drawing cards as long as it has a score less than 17.

#Hint 13: Create a function called compare() and pass in the user_score and computer_score. If the computer and user both have the same score, then it's a draw. If the computer has a blackjack (0), then the user loses. If the user has a blackjack (0), then the user wins. If the user_score is over 21, then the user loses. If the computer_score is over 21, then the computer loses. If none of the above, then the player with the highest score wins.

#Hint 14: Ask the user if they want to restart the game. If they answer yes, clear the console and start a new game of blackjack and show the logo from art.py.
