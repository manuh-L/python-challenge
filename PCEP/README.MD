![PCEP – Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer](https://github.com/manuh-L/python-challenge/blob/main/PCEP/pcep.png)


Here's the content I used to prepare for the exam [PCEP-30-02:](https://pythoninstitute.org/pcep)

1. Udemy course [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). It's a good course, From day 1 - 13 is enough, it covers the exam syllabus/blueprint. You will learn by building projects in python.

2. A Cloud Guru [Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer Certification](https://acloudguru.com/course/certified-entry-level-python-programmer-certification). Course focused on the certification exam.

3. Free – Edube Interactive Course [Python Essentials 1](https://edube.org/study/pe1). Free course recommended by the Python Institute.


This content is enough to prepare if you are new to coding/programming or come from another background like me. Else I would recommend to start with [PCAP – Certified Associate in Python Programming](https://pythoninstitute.org/pcap)
