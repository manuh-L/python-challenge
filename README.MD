# Python :snake:100 days Challenge

I'm learning python by doing the 100 days of code challenge, following the course [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). In parallel, I'm also using this challenge to help me prepare for Python Certifications :wink:.
